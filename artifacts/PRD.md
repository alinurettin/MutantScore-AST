# 📊 Product Requirements Document (PRD): MutantScore-AST
- **Project:** MutantScore-AST
- **Discipline:** Mutation Testing & Test Suite Quality Assessment
- **Author:** Expert Business Analyst & QA Lead
- **Status:** APPROVED & FINAL
- **Target Audience:** SDETs, QA Automation Engineers, Backend Developers, DevOps Engineers

## 1. Core Objectives & Value Proposition
Provide an automated, high-speed, enterprise-grade test automation microservice and CLI tool implementing Mutation Testing & Test Suite Quality Assessment. Enable software delivery teams to detect regressions prior to production deployment with zero false positives.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **FR-1 (Core Verification):** Ingest input payloads and execute algorithmic validation without mock dependencies.
- **FR-2 (Real-Time Metrics):** Provide an embedded HTTP REST API (`/api/health`, `/api/...`) emitting structured JSON telemetry and test verdicts.
- **FR-3 (Developer CLI):** Support immediate local terminal execution via `node src/cli.js` with structured standard output.
- **FR-4 (Interactive Console):** Host a responsive dark-mode diagnostic web interface on port 7071.

## 3. Behavioral Specifications (Given-When-Then BDD)
```gherkin
Feature: Mutation Testing & Test Suite Quality Assessment Automation Engine
  Scenario: Automated execution of MutantScore-AST verification
    Given a configured test environment and input payload
    When the MutantScore-AST engine executes validation
    Then verify all assertions against deterministic mathematical criteria
    And produce structured JSON telemetry with 0% flakiness
```

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **P99 Latency:** < 20ms for full test execution cycle.
- **Resilience:** Graceful error handling with descriptive diagnostics on malformed inputs.
- **Zero Mock Policy:** 100% non-mocked test assertions verifying real mathematical logic.
